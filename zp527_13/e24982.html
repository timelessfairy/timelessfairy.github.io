Widely acknowledged as the most influential landscape designer of his age Lancelot “Capability” Brown was to England what Frederick Law Olmsted was to America?responsible for shaping the very ideal of the nation’s park. Brown’s ambition was to bring out of a landscape the best of its potential rather than impose his own ideas upon it. His designs are organic weaving gestures of color and perspective into the features that the country already afforded. So natural are his designs and so perfectly do they complement the houses within them that for many a Capability Brown landscape is the epitome of the English estate. His gardens and parks?as much as the houses themselves?would become icons of British country life. Published to coincide with the tercentenary of his birth this remarkable book illuminates fifteen of Brown’s most celebrated landscapes. To love the great English estates is to love the settings with which Brown surrounded them?from idyllic parks at Milton and Broadlands to structured landscapes around iconic houses at Blenheim Burghley Wakefield and Chatsworth.

These images celebrate the soft English light while capturing the natural parkland beauty of Brown"s designs in particular have a painterly feel evoking the work of 17th century romantic landscape painters such as Claude. Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. Some have an epic quality with dramatic lowering thunder-cloud?filled skies others featuring the pale blue skies of a pretty English summer day. The photographs are a fitting tribute to the man who gardened on a grand scale. Phipps writes that Capability Brown “liked to call himself a ‘place-maker’ but was more often described as a magician. That sense of magic and mystery persists as we try to understand Brown today.” This book certainly captures the magic."<br>?New York Journal of Books<br>"In word and image this book matches Brown’s achievement. It should inspire every landscape designer and encourage the rest of us to hop on the next plane to Britain."<br>?FormMag.net<br>"There"s the new "Capability Brown" garden book from Rizzoli which is fantastic." <br>?StyleSaloniste.com<br>"Praised for his organic gardens and parks British landscape designer Capability Brown takes top billing in this eponymous hardcover by historian John Phibbs.
